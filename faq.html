				<div class="collapsible-header center-align s12 m4 14 ">Return Policy?</div>
				<div class="collapsible-body red darken-1 white-text">
					<p class="center-align">Systems: <br>If your system is defective, it can be returned or exchanged within two weeks from date of purchase.</p>
					<p class="center-align">Games: <br>Defective games can be returned or exchanged within 1 week.</p>
					<p class="center-align">New Items: <br>New items cannot be returned if they have been opened.</p>
					<p class="center-align">Buyer's Remorse:<br>If you decide you just don't want what you bought nearly as much as you thought you did, items can be returned within two days.</p>
					<p class="center-align">If you are unable to get to the store within the return time, please give us a call (within the eligible return period) and we'll try to work something out.</p>
				</div>				
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="collapsible-header center-align s12 m4 l4">Do You Repair Systems?</div>			
				<div class="collapsible-body blue-grey darken-1 white-text">
					<p>Short answer: No.</p>
					<p>Long answer: Due to the hit-or-miss nature of system repair, we do not offer this as a service. We DO repair our own systems to make sure they are fully functional.
					<br>We also sell a small number of replacement parts (like N64 joysticks or NES 72 Pin connectors) if you're feeling adventurous enough to attempt your own repairs.
					</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="collapsible-header center-align s12 m4 14 center-align">Selling or Trading Games: How does that work?</div>
				<div class="collapsible-body red darken-1 white-text">
					<p>We will pay cash or offer store credit for your new or used games and systems.</p>
					<p>We offer more for store credit than for cash.</p>
					<p>You must be 18 or older to sell/trade and have an ID with you at the time of trade.</p>
				</div>				
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="collapsible-header center-align s12 m4 l4">How Much Will I Get If I Sell/Trade My __________ ?</div>
				<div class="collapsible-body blue-grey darken-1 white-text">
					<p>Every item has a different price, based on factors like popularity, rarity, and demand.</p>
					<p>For a quote on the items you wish to sell/trade, please call us. If you have a long list of items, please email it to us, and we will get back to you as soon as we can.</p>

				<div class="collapsible-header center-align s12 m4 14 ">My Gameboy Game Doesn't Save. Can You Fix This?</div>
				<div class="collapsible-body red darken-1 white-text">
					<p class="center-align">Yes! We will replace the internal battery in your cartridge games (which is the typical cause of "corrupted" saved games).</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="collapsible-header center-align s12 m4 l4">My Game Is Scratched. Can You Fix It?</div>
				<div class="collapsible-body blue-grey darken-1 white-text">
					<p>Short answer: Probably.</p>
					<p>Long answer: We have the best disc-resurfacer available, but it can't do magic (although, it comes close sometimes).
					<br>Our machine can repair your average wear-and-tear scratches, but not deep gouges or disc-warping.
					<br>We'd be happy to look at your disc(s) and let you know whether or not we think your disc can be repaired.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>We charge $2.50 per disc</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="collapsible-header center-align s12 m4 14 center-align">How Do The Rewards Cards Work?</div>
				<div class="collapsible-body red darken-1 white-text">
					<p>Short answer: 10% of your total purchase will be added to your rewards card, which can be used as store credit.</p>
					<p>Long answer: Every dollar you spend at our store is equal to one "point". You must accrue 20 points before it becomes useable as store credit.</p>
					<p>10 Points = $1 in store credit.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="collapsible-header center-align s12 m4 l4">What's With All Of The Shaq Stuff?</div>
				<div class="collapsible-body blue-grey darken-1 white-text">
					<p>Short answer: It's a joke that's gotten out of hand.</p>
					<p>Long answer: When the first Shaq-Fu was traded in, we decided to frame it. And although Shaq-Fu isn't a particularly rare game, we didn't see it very often.
						Every time a new Shaq-Fu was traded in, we framed it.
						<br>
						At some point, friends and customers began bringing in Shaq paraphernalia to add to the collection. Now, our Shaq collection has evolved into an amalgam of random items from Shaq Soda to Shaq action figures (Shaqtion Figures).</p>
					<br>
					<p>Shorter answer: Shaq is great.</p>

				<div class="collapsible-header center-align s12 m4 14 center-align">Do You Have Battletoads?</div>
				<div class="collapsible-body red darken-1 white-text">
					<p>Probably.</p>
					<p>We generally have it in stock, but Battletoads does sell out from time to time.</p>					
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="collapsible-header center-align s12 m4 l4">Are There Any Other Core Gaming Locations?</div>
				<div class="collapsible-body blue-grey darken-1 white-text">
					<p class="center-align">Nope!</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="collapsible-header center-align s12 m4 14 center-align">Can You Order A Game For Me?</div>
				<div class="collapsible-body red darken-1 white-text">
					<p>Nope!</p>
					<p>But we CAN add you to a list and let you know when we eventually get it in stock!</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="collapsible-header center-align s12 m4 l4">Where Do All Your Games Come From?</div>
				<div class="collapsible-body blue-grey darken-1 white-text">
					<p>Almost all of our inventory comes from what we buy from our customers. <br> Due to the random nature of buying and trading, we don't know how long it will take us to get a particular item in stock. It may be weeks, it may be months.</p>
