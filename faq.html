					<h6>Return Policy?</h6>
					<div class="card red darken-1">
						<div class="card-content white-text">
					<p>Systems: If your system is defective, it can be returned or exchanged within two weeks from date of purchase.</p>
					<p>Games: Defective games can be returned or exchanged within 1 week.</p>
					<p>New Items: New items cannot be returned if they have been opened.</p>
					<p>Buyer's Remorse: If you decide you just don't want what you bought nearly as much as you thought you did, items can be returned within two days.</p>
					<p class="center-align">If you are unable to get to the store within the return time, please give us a call (within the eligible return period) and we'll try to work something out.</p>

				<div class="col s12 m4 l4">
					<h6>Do You Repair Systems?</h6>
					<div class="card blue-grey darken-1">
						<div class="card-content white-text">
							<p>Short answer: No.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Long answer: Due to the hit-or-miss nature of system repair, we do not offer this as a service. We DO repair our own systems to make sure they are fully functional.
							<br>We also sell a small number of replacement parts (like N64 joysticks or NES 72 Pin connectors) if you're feeling adventurous enough to attempt your own repairs.
							</p>

					<h6>Selling or Trading Games:<br>How does that work?</h6>
					<div class="card red darken-1">
						<div class="card-content white-text">
					<p>We will pay cash or offer store credit for your new or used games and systems.</p>
					<p>We offer more for store credit than for cash.</p>
					<p>You must be 18 or older to sell/trade and have an ID with you at the time of trade.</p>

					<h6>How Much Will I Get If I Sell/Trade My __________ ?</h6>
					<div class="card blue-grey darken-1">
						<div class="card-content white-text">
							<p>Every item has a different price, based on factors like popularity, rarity, and demand.</p>
							<p>For a quote on the items you wish to sell/trade, please call us. If you have a long list of items, please email it to us, and we will get back to you as soon as we can.</p>

					<h6>My Gameboy Game Doesn't Save. Can You Fix This?</h6>
					<div class="card red darken-1">
						<div class="card-content white-text">
					<p class="center-align">Yes!</p>
					<p class="center-align">We will replace the internal battery in your cartridge games (which is the typical cause of "corrupted" saved games).</p>

					<h6>My Game Is Scratched. Can You Fix It?</h6>
					<div class="card blue-grey darken-1">
						<div class="card-content white-text">
							<p>Short answer: Probably.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Long answer: We have the best disc-resurfacer available, but it can't do magic (although, it comes close sometimes).
							<br>Our machine can repair your average wear-and-tear scratches, but not deep gouges or disc-warping.
							<br>We'd be happy to look at your disc(s) and let you know whether or not we think your disc can be repaired.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>We charge $2.50 per disc</p>

					<h6>How do the Rewards Cards Work?</h6>
					<div class="card red darken-1">
						<div class="card-content white-text">
					<p>Short answer: 10% of your total purchase will be added to your rewards card, which can be used as store credit.</p>
					
					<p>Long answer: Every dollar you spend at our store is equal to one "point". You must accrue 20 points before it becomes useable as store credit.</p>
					<p>10 Points = $1 in store credit.</p>

					<h6>What's With All of the Shaq Stuff?</h6>
					<div class="card blue-grey darken-1">
						<div class="card-content white-text">
							<p>Short answer: It's a joke that's gotten out of hand.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Long answer: When the first Shaq-Fu was traded in, we decided to frame it. And although Shaq-Fu isn't a particularly rare game, we didn't see it very often.
								Every time a new Shaq-Fu was traded in, we framed it.
								<br>
								At some point, friends and customers began bringing in Shaq paraphernalia to add to the collection. Now, our Shaq collection has evolved into an amalgam of random items from Shaq Soda to Shaq action figures (Shaqtion Figures).</p>
							<br>
							<p>Shorter answer: Shaq is great.</p>
